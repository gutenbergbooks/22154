<p>Carr Parker sat day-dreaming
at the <i>Nomad's</i>
controls. More than a week
of Earth time had passed
since the self-styled
"vagabonds
of space" had left
Europa, and now
they were fast
approaching the
great ringed orb of Saturn with the
intention of exploring her satellites.</p>

<p>Behind him, his Martian friend,
Mado, was manipulating
the mechanism
of the <i>rulden</i>,
that remarkable
Europan optical
instrument
which Detis had installed in the
vessel before they left. Mado was
utterly fascinated by the machine,
having spent most of his time
during the voyage searching the
surfaces of Saturn's moons for
signs of human habitation. Now, as
they headed directly for Titan, the
sixth satellite, he was completely
absorbed in an examination of the
heavy cloud layer that covered it.</p>

<p>But Carr's thoughts were of his
bride, who still slumbered in their
stateroom amidships. In his bachelor
days he never had imagined
he could find such contentment as
had come with his marriage to Ora.
He had fought shy of the fair sex
on Earth. Somehow, the women he
knew back home had bored him;
angling for a man's money and position,
most of them, and incapable
of giving real love and companionship
in return for the luxuries they
demanded. He was resigned to his
single state.</p>

<p>But all that was changed by the
little blue-eyed girl he had met in
Paladar. She was a different sort;
worth a hundred of those others
and fulfilling to perfection the
ideal he had always set up. On her
world, Jupiter's satellite, Europa,
he had neither wealth nor influence;
he'd left these behind when
he deserted Earth for a life of
vagabondage among the stars. But,
to the daughter of Detis, this lack
meant less than nothing; his love,
and hers, meant everything.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And, what a good sport she had
been! When they were threatened
by Rapaju and his minions;
when they barely escaped being
swallowed up by that monster of
space which Mado had likened to
the Sargasso Sea of Earth; when
she herself proposed joining them
in their rovings throughout the
universe.</p>

<p>She was a companion of whom
even the phlegmatic Martian was
proud, she brought with her presence
on the <i>Nomad</i> a subtle something
that made of the coldly mechanical
space-ship a thing of new
beauty and a place of cheerfulness&mdash;a
home. And, to think he had
won her for his own. To think....</p>

<p>"Carr!" Mado's sharp exclamation
startled him from his pleasant
thoughts. "Come here and take a
look at this," the Martian demanded,
his voice betraying an excitement
unusual for him. "Something
is wrong on this satellite
we're heading for."</p>

<p>Locking the controls in the automatic
position, Carr turned to join
his friend at the viewing-disk of
the rulden. Mado had found an
opening in the heavy cloud layer,
and before them was an unobstructed
view of a rugged countryside
where huge boulders had been
scattered by the mighty hand of
creation and where the sun shone
weakly on the rim of a yawning
crater in which sulphurous vapors
curled. They saw this strange land
as from an altitude of a few hundred
feet, though the <i>Nomad</i> was
still more than a million miles
from the satellite.</p>

<p>"What's wrong about that?" Carr
grunted. "Excepting that it's just
another of these barren and useless
bodies that doesn't even provide us
with an attracting interest."</p>

<p>"Wait," Mado replied, "You'll see
in a moment. Something&mdash;"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At that instant there came a
puff of blue flame from out
the pit, carrying on its heated
breath a drifting sheet of incandescence
that fluttered and pulsated
like a thing alive. Mado switched
on the sound mechanism of the
rulden and the roaring of the pillar
of flame came to their ears. There
were other sounds as well; the
babble of alien voices and the rumble
of drums.</p>

<p>Immediately the rough ground in
the vicinity was filled with creatures
of human mold, half naked
red-skinned beings that rose up
from behind the boulders and
rushed toward the pit of fire and
the uncanny heat mantle that wandered
ghost-like along its rim. Two
of them carried something between
them, a struggling writhing something
which they stood erect at the
crater's edge. It was a girl!&mdash;a slim,
bronzed figure that swayed there an
instant uncertainly as the throb of
the drums rose high and the voices
of the assembled savages swelled
in a monotony of exultant chanting.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Carr gasped. "A
human sacrifice!"</p>

<p>A quick push, a piercing scream
immediately drowned out by the
cries of the multitude, and the girl
was flung headlong into the welcoming
folds of the white-hot
ghost-mantle which hovered there
like some greedy monster of the
lava pools of Mercury. The thing
closed in around the wildly struggling
body, enwrapping it with
exultant constrictions of its hell-born
substance and diving, flapping,
smoking heat devil, into the flame
from whence it had sprung. Mado
touched a lever with quick trembling
fingers and the rulden's disk
went blank.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Sickened by what they had
seen, the two friends stared at
one another, white-faced.</p>

<p>"No place for us," Mado said,
after a moment. "Not with Ora."</p>

<p>"Right!" Carr agreed grimly.
"But I'd like to get in close enough
to see more of Titan. How high is
this cloud layer?"</p>

<p>"About a mile above the surface.
We can dive through and look
them over; perhaps give them a
taste of the disintegrator."</p>

<p>"Attaboy! You took the words
out of my mouth. The devils!
Who'd ever dream of such a horror
in the twenty-fourth century&mdash;even
out here?"</p>

<p>"What's the reason for this
serious discussion?" The voice of
Detis broke in on them from the
door of the control room.</p>

<p>"Plenty!" Carr exclaimed. And
the Europan listened gravely as he
described the awful thing they had
witnessed.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," he said
calmly, when the Terrestrial ended
his recital. "There are certain
emanations from the mother planet
that most certainly will affect the
mentality and baser instincts of a
race living within their influence.
I have been studying these vibrations
for several hours."</p>

<p>They turned to the forward port
as the scientist indicated the great
orb of Saturn with its gleaming
rings. Now, as they drew near to
the enormous planet, it did indeed
seem that there was a sinister
quality in its shifting luminosity.
Carr shivered, thinking of Ora.</p>

<p>"You mean," Mado asked, "that
there are vibrations in the ether
hereabouts that are set up electrically
by the planet?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Or rather I should
say they are set up by the vast
number of whirling particles of
which its encircling rings are composed.
The wave form propagated
is of a characteristic that is in tune
with those portions of the brain
which control the savage impulses.
We may certainly expect to find
superstition-ridden ignorance and
all manner of vice prevalent in the
races of Titan."</p>

<p>"You think these vibrations will
affect us?" Carr inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not if we make our visit short.
The intensity is quite low."</p>

<p>"It'll be a short visit, all right.
We'll be in Titan's atmosphere in
about forty minutes now, and, if
I have my say, we'll be out of
it and away again inside of an
hour."</p>

<p>"Best thing you've said today,"
Mado approved. "But let's have another
look in the rulden. We may
find other gaps in the clouds."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The mechanism of the radio
telescope whirred into life as
he spoke and its disk shone bright
with the reflected light of Titan
as it pictured the body. The <i>Nomad</i>
was speeding toward the ill-omened
satellite at the rate of more than
a thousand miles a second.</p>

<p>But the surface was nowhere visible
and Mado adjusted the focus
so that the view of the billowy
cloud-covering fell rapidly away.
Though actually they were approaching
the satellite with tremendous
velocity, it receded swiftly in
the rulden's disk until the entire
body showed as a perfect sphere of
uniform brilliancy. All surface
markings were concealed by the
blanket of clouds.</p>

<p>"Just a moment, Mado," said
Detis. "I believe I saw something."</p>

<p>The Martian pressed a button
and the image was stationary. A
tiny black spot had appeared near
one edge of the satellite's disk and
this now spread rapidly like a blot
of spilled ink. Then it stretched
out into a wriggling line that
quickly streaked its way across the
equator, completely banding the
body as they watched. A moment
it lay there like a great serpent
encircling the globe, and then it
vanished in a flash of intense light
that left them blinking in amazement.
It was as if a trail of gunpowder
had been laid across the
surface and then set off by a torch
in the hand of some unseen giant
of the cosmos. A strange electrical
storm that agitated the cloud
blanket mightily, then left it more
densely closed in than before.</p>

<p>Through the forward port the
satellite could be seen with the
naked eye, growing larger now and
resolving itself into a tiny globe.
To Carr it seemed that the diminutive
moon winked provocatively as
he turned to regard it without the
rulden's aid. Off to the west, Saturn
and her rings almost filled the
sky, and their baleful light shone
cold and menacing against the black
velvet of the heavens.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mado took the controls when
the <i>Nomad</i> entered the atmosphere
of Titan and drifted over
the sea of clouds. He corrected the
altimeter for the mass of this body
of three thousand miles diameter,
and noted that they were up about
six thousand feet. Test samples indicated
that the outside air,
although thin, was pure. But they
did not open the ports as they
had no intention of landing.</p>

<p>Ora had not yet awakened and
Carr hoped fervently that she would
not do so until they had left the
immediate vicinity of Titan. It was
vastly better if she missed seeing
anything of the barbarians of the
cloudy satellite. Besides, with her
adventuresome and fearless nature,
she'd not be satisfied merely to look
on from afar&mdash;she'd want them to
land. And that must not be done.</p>

<p>Something tinkled metallically
against the hull plates of the vessel.
Again and again the sound was repeated,
and soon they saw that the
air was filled with driving particles
which clattered on the thick glass
of the ports and contacted resoundingly
with the hull. A vast cloud of
black loomed directly ahead, springing
up from the tossing cloud
banks; and Mado yanked at the controls,
swerving the <i>Nomad</i> sharply
from her course.</p>

<p>But there was no escaping the
fury of that sudden squall; they
were in the thick of it in an instant,
and the ship was buffeted
and tossed about as if it were a toy.
Millions of the driving particles
battered the <i>Nomad</i> and the din
of their pounding was terrific as the
ship was whirled deeper into the
midst of the tempest.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carr saw that the black particles
were piling up around
the rim of the port, sticking fast
to the metal of the hull. They were
bristling in fantastic array, like
iron filings adhering to the poles of
a magnet. In a flash it came to him
that these particles were magnetic;
the <i>Nomad</i> was covered with them
and they piled on ever more
thickly, soon weighting her down
so heavily that she lost altitude.
They were at the mercy of a
furious electrical storm of mysterious
nature.</p>

<p>"Imps of the canals!" Mado
shouted above the din. "We're finished!
The machinery is paralyzed.
This iron hail is charged."</p>

<p>The viewing port was completely
covered over now with particles
that arched across from rim to rim,
slender rod-like things about two
inches long and of the thickness of
heavy wire. Black, they were, as
black as graphite. Detis worked
frantically with Mado at the useless
controls, vainly endeavoring
to stabilize the pitching vessel.</p>

<p>Dazed by the suddenness of the
calamity, Carr turned to look at the
altimeter. Five thousand feet, forty-five
hundred, four thousand! Nose
down, and reeling drunkenly, the
<i>Nomad</i> was diving to certain disaster
on the rocky ground of Titan.
He dashed from the control room,
calling distractedly to Ora as he
raced along the passageway.</p>

<p>She staggered from the stateroom
and into his arms, a slim, boyish
figure in her snug leather
jacket and breeches. Together they
were flung violently against the
partition by a heavy lurch of the
vessel.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she gasped, clinging
to him for support.</p>

<p>"A freak storm, in Titan's atmosphere.
Guess the <i>Nomad's</i> done
for." Carr drew her fiercely close
as an awful picture flashed across
his mind&mdash;of Ora's body mangled
in twisted wreckage; of the savages
finding it, down there....</p>

<p>The metal floor-plates seemed to
buckle and hurl themselves aft with
a grinding crash of disrupted joints.
Holding desperately to the precious
little body within his arms, Carr
was thrown off his feet. There was
a detonation as if the universe had
been blasted into oblivion&mdash;then
darkness, and numbed silence.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Carr, you're hurt!" Ora
moaned.</p>

<p>He was&mdash;a little. His head was
splitting and the taste of blood was
in his mouth, but it was nothing
serious. He'd been half knocked
out, but his head was clearing
already. Of far greater importance
was the fact that Ora was unharmed;
he satisfied himself of that
immediately.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he grunted,
struggling to his feet and feeling
around in the blackness.</p>

<p>The lights in the passage were
out and he groped blindly along
the partition, the metal of which
had suddenly become very hot to
the touch. There was a curious feeling
of lightness as if his body had
no weight at all; the ship rolled
gently and he knew they were falling
swiftly to the inevitable crash.
Yet he clung fast to Ora, and, together,
they made their way to the
control room.</p>

<p>Faint daylight streamed in
through the ports there and he saw
Mado and Detis, both bleeding
from injuries they had received
when the mysterious shock hurled
them amongst the control mechanisms.
They were working
furiously with the exciter-generator,
which had stopped. The
<i>Nomad</i> was without power and helpless
to exert her anti-gravity
energy.</p>

<p>"The iron hail!" gasped the Europan
scientist. "It gave up its charge,
Carr&mdash;exploded. Here, give us a
hand and see if we can get the
generators started."</p>

<p>The ports were clear of the black
particles and Carr saw that the
outer surface of the glass was
cracked and darkened from the
heat of the blast. He understood,
remembering the black band and the
flash they had seen across the cloud
layer from afar. And in the instant
of remembering he saw that the
ground was very near, rushing upward
to meet them. A coil of the
exciter-armature broke away in his
fingers; the thing had been burned
out by the electric storm, and the
<i>Nomad</i> was doomed.</p>

<p>The altimeter needle moved with
sickening speed and already registered
but little more than five
hundred feet. Four hundred! Carr
braced himself for the impending
crash and gathered Ora in his arms.</p>

<p>And then a strange thing happened.
Four light rays, dazzling in
intensity, stabbed up at them from
the forest beneath them and converged
on the vessel's hull. The
<i>Nomad</i> staggered, then came to an
even keel and slackened in her
mad dash to the surface. She vibrated
from stem to stern under
the mighty conflict of energies and
they felt themselves pressed hard
against the floor-plate. But the mysterious
energy beams had come too
late to save them. A densely
wooded slope loomed directly
ahead. There was a crashing of
branches and the rending of
mighty trunks, and the <i>Nomad</i>
came to a jarring stop.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Devils of Terra!" Mado
ejaculated. "We're in a fine
fix now. We'll have to set foot on
Titan whether we want to or not."</p>

<p>Carr had laughed, somewhat
shakily, in relief. They were safe,
all of them, and no one much hurt.
And the generator coils could be
rewound. But he sobered instantly
at Mado's words; they'd have to
produce copper and insulating materials
for the job.</p>

<p>"Right," he agreed. "And that's
not so good."</p>

<p>"What's so terrible about landing
here?" Ora inquired. "I thought
we were expecting to explore this
satellite." She looked up from her
ministrations to Detis, who had a
nasty scalp wound.</p>

<p>"The people here are dangerous
savages," Carr answered gravely.
"At least some of them are; we
saw them in the rulden. You'll have
to remain aboard while we look up
the ones who projected those rays
and do some bargaining with them."</p>

<p>"What! You expect me to hide
in the vessel while you're at work
outside? Not much! I want to see
something of Titan while we are
here." Her pretty chin was set in
that determined manner she had.</p>

<p>"I tell you it's too risky!" Carr
was firm, but he looked at Mado
beseechingly, signaling for his support.</p>

<p>But the Martian only grinned
owlishly. He knew as well as did
Carr that Ora would have her way.</p>

<p>"Risky&mdash;pooh!" she returned.
"I'm not afraid. We have our ray
pistols and the funny torpedoes you
brought from Mars. Besides, I don't
believe it's as bad as you think."</p>

<p>Carr shrugged his shoulders.
After all, they probably would not
encounter any of the savages here
in the forest. Beings of far
greater intelligence were responsible
for those rays, that much was
certain. Besides, they'd be three
able-bodied men out there to watch
over her, and he'd make sure she
didn't get too far away from the
ship.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carr was first to step from
the opened manhole to the soft
carpet of the Titanese forest. He
found the air cool and crisp, with
a tang of ozone assailing his nostrils.
There was a pulsating motion
in it that he could hardly define;
it seemed that it massaged his
cheeks and raised the short hairs
at the nape of his neck and on his
forearms as if they were electrified.
Those vibrations Detis had told
them about were actively at work.</p>

<p>The gravity was even less than
on Mars, though slightly greater
than that of Europa. Mado was
entirely at ease, and the Europans
would not be bothered by the slight
change in their weight. But Carr
would have to take it easy, as he'd
done ever since leaving Earth. His
muscles were too powerful for his
body on these smaller worlds,
though this was a mighty advantage
if he took care not to over-exert.</p>

<p>A melodious whistling note rose
high somewhere in the depths of
the forest and trailed off into eery
silence. The sky was overcast with
gray clouds and the light was poor,
of little more than twilight intensity
on Terra, this being partly due
to the masking of the sun by the
clouds and partly to their tremendous
distance from that radiant
body. Odd that it was not colder, he
thought. Probably those vibratory
radiations of Saturn's rings had
something to do with the temperature
in addition to their other effects.</p>

<p>Detis was on his knees, examining
a queer specimen of purplish
moss which had drawn his eye. The
eternal scientist in the man could
not be downed. Mado had come out
armed with one of the bulky kalbite
torpedo-projectors and was
looking around belligerently.</p>

<p>Ora drew herself erect and took
a deep breath as soon as her feet
touched the ground, her eyes bright
and her cheeks flushed with excitement.
"Oh, Carr," she breathed,
"it's marvelous; an honest-to-goodness
virgin forest. We've neither of
us ever seen one, you know. Aren't
you thrilled?"</p>

<p>"We-e-ll," he admitted, "I've
always looked forward to wandering
in just such places. But, with
you along, and thinking of those
barbarians we saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silly. I'm as capable as any of
you. And, even if I couldn't look
out for myself, I know that you
will be at my side." She pursed
her lips and tossed back her head
provocatively.</p>

<p>What was a man to do?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A deep-toned booming note
came then from the hills, commencing
like the warning siren of
a space liner approaching its berth
and swelling to a bombilation of
ear-shattering sound that set the
steel of the <i>Nomad's</i> hull vibrating
and their very flesh and bones
a-tingle. Then it died away as had
the bird note which was the first
sound of this world to greet them.</p>

<p>"Jupiter! What's that?" Mado
unslung his torpedo-projector.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his startled
question, a weird object drifted
over the treetops and poised directly
above them, about fifty feet
up. An egg-shaped thing, six or
seven feet in length, and seemingly
made of white metal. It swayed
there gently, without visible means
of support, and they could make out
a transparent disk on its side, back
of which there was a human head
with eyes that regarded them
curiously.</p>

<p>Mado raised his torpedo tube and
took aim.</p>

<p>"Hold it!" Carr warned him.
"This fellow's no savage. Probably
he's one of those who tried to break
our fall. Friendly, perhaps."</p>

<p>Two more of the ovoids drifted
in from the woods and joined the
first one, all three settling a few
feet lower and their occupants
staring intently at the intruders.</p>

<p>"I'll get the psycho-ray apparatus,"
Detis said excitedly. "We
may be able to get thought contact
with them." He dived through the
<i>Nomad's</i> entrance-manhole as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Nothing so frightening about
these creatures," Ora murmured,
her eyes reproaching Carr. "Why,
they seem anxious to know that
<i>we</i> are not enemies."</p>

<p>And, indeed, this seemed to be
the case, for the strange ovoids
wafted still lower, dropping until
a faint humming of the internal
gravity mechanism came to their
ears. These were a highly developed
people of scientific attainment;
civilized beings. But Mado
kept firm hold of his torpedo tube,
and Carr fingered the ray pistol at
his belt.</p>

<p>The booming note from the hills
came then, frightfully near this
time, and the three ovoids moved
with sudden roaring of their motors,
literally hurling themselves
skyward. But the menace they
sought to escape was real, and not
to be outdone in speed. A vast
black something whirred out from
beyond the treetops and flung itself
upon them.</p>

<p>"A pterodactyl!" Mado gasped.
"One of the prehistoric monsters of
Terra!"</p>

<p>"Carr, there are men riding it!"
Ora exclaimed. "Red men!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was true; the pteranodon, a
horrid bat-like thing with a
wing-spread of fully twenty feet,
carried three of the bronzed savages
clinging to a sort of harness
that encircled its body just back
of the crested head. The huge flying
reptile whistled raucously as it
flew and one of the savages was
whirling a sling which held a stone
as large as his own head. They
watched in amazement as the swift
aerial steed flapped its way after
the rising ovoids. And then the savage
let loose an end of his thong
and released its missile, which
crashed full against the transparent
disk of an ovoid and tore its way
through.</p>

<p>The damaged ovoid careened
violently and then fell end over
end, crashing in the forest. With a
bellow of fury, Mado fired with the
kalbite tube at his hip. There was
the twang of the propelling ray,
and the slender arrow-like torpedo
sped forth on its message of death,
singing spitefully as it cleaved the
air of Titan.</p>

<p>It was a fair hit, catching the
pteranodon just ahead of its trailing
legs and exploding with the
characteristic screaming roar of
the deadly kalbite. The monstrous
reptile and its crew of barbarians
vanished in a blaze that lighted the
clouds above them and brought a
babble of excited shoutings from the
depths of the forest on all sides.
They were surrounded by the uncivilized
ones of Titan! And those
of the ovoids had run off at the
first sign of danger.</p>

<p>The din from the forest was augmented
by the whistlings of a second
pteranodon which darted after
the remaining ovoids, following
swiftly as these retreated with ludicrous,
wabbling haste.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ora screamed and struck out
at something with her fist. A
naked arm had reached out from
the underbrush and grasped her
wrist. Carr wheeled and his ray
pistol spat crackling flame. The
savage, an undersized red man with
an enormous head, rose unsteadily
from his hiding place, a look of
terrible hate in his contorted features.
Then, like a punctured balloon,
his body collapsed into the
nothingness of complete disintegration.</p>

<p>"Back, back to the <i>Nomad</i>!" Carr
roared, dragging Ora with him and
leveling his pistol at a group of
the bronze brutes who rushed into
the space where the vessel lay
amongst the trees.</p>

<p>Mado was busy with his torpedo
tube and a vast explosion shook
the ground beneath them as a trio
of the savages were blasted out of
existence. A great tree toppled and
crashed across the nose of the
<i>Nomad</i>, its roots ripped from the
soil by the concussion.</p>

<p>Ora had whipped out her own
pistol and was firing as they fell
back. Game kid, she was! Carr
gloated as he saw she was making
each shot tell. But this couldn't
last; there were hundreds of them
now, long-armed and big-headed
red devils swarming in from every
direction. Carr dodged none too
quickly to save his skull from a
swift-flung stone, which clanged
against the <i>Nomad's</i> hull. There was
a perfect hail of the missiles now:
one struck his left arm a numbing
blow, and he heard a sickening
thud and Ora's moan as she was
hit. And there were winged darts,
from blow-guns.</p>

<p>A dusky moon-face leered into
his own, horribly close, and he
yelled his rage as he drove it back
with a swift uppercut. But the
horde of savages came on in ever
increasing numbers and with renewed
vigor.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;inside!" Carr hissed in
Ora's ear as his fingers found the
rim of the manhole. He'd have her
safely within in a moment.</p>

<p>Detis clambered out with the
thought machine in his arms, and
a singing dart from one of the
blow-guns pierced him through and
through. A look of astonishment
spread over his kindly features,
and he fell forward, dying.</p>

<p>And then Carr looked up into a
grinning face behind a huge club
that was swinging downward. He
threw up his arm to break the force
of the blow, but the club fell too
swiftly; the enormous weight of it
crashed down on his skull, and he
knew no more.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When he awakened it was
to stare for a dazed moment
into a pair of blue eyes that looked
down upon him in a place of dim
light and stuffy atmosphere. The
eyes were only vaguely familiar in
his befuddled memory. Beautiful
eyes, though, and incredibly
dear....</p>

<p>"Ora!" he exclaimed, in wondering
remembrance, trying to sit up
as he grasped her hand.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she warned him, placing
a finger-tip to his lips. "Be quiet
now and perhaps they'll leave us
alone for a while."</p>

<p>"They! Did they capture us?" he
whispered. "Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"We're prisoners, all right, excepting
poor father. But they didn't
harm <i>me</i> much, outside of the
rough handling."</p>

<p>"The devils. What of Detis?"
He was growing stronger by the
minute and now saw that they were
in an open-mouthed cave and that
Mado was sitting hunched dejectedly
in a corner, his massive shoulders
drooping and his proud head
bowed on his chest.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;they killed him," Ora
sighed almost inaudibly. "Have you
forgotten? We saw the dart strike
him and I&mdash;I saw it sticking from
his chest. Oh, Carr!" A dry sob
caught in her throat.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. Lord!" Carr groaned,
sick at heart with the sudden recollection
and full of compassion
for the stricken girl.</p>

<p>He patted her hand with clumsy
tenderness as she turned her head
and gazed out through the cave
mouth in silence that was fraught
with intense pain. She would take
it like that: with little to say but
with much inward suffering.</p>

<p>And then he noticed a fourth
occupant of the cavern, a young
lad of Titan. Like one of the savages
in his small stature and in the
large size of his head, he was much
lighter in color and his body was
encased in a snug one-piece garment
of shimmering material of silky
texture. And there was a different
light in his eyes, the light of intelligence
and culture.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" Carr whispered.</p>

<p>Ora stared when she saw that
the stranger was on his feet. "Oh,"
she exclaimed, "I'm glad he has
recovered. He's one of the civilized
ones; they captured him with his
ovoid when the second pteranodon
went out after them."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mado was standing now, endeavoring
to communicate
with the lad by means of signs and
the drawing of crude pictures in
the red sand of the cavern floor.
The graceful little fellow watched
him with understanding and with
a smile of amused tolerance. Then
he halted the big Martian with an
imperious motion, addressing him
in velvety voice.</p>

<p>"Nazu," he said simply, placing
a forefinger on his breast and bowing
before the astonished Mado.</p>

<p>"Imps of the canals!" the Martian
exclaimed, grinning delightedly as
he cast a swift look at Carr and
Ora. "He's telling me his name."
"Mine's Mado," he said, turning
his eyes to the keen gray ones
that smiled up at him. "Mado," he
repeated, placing a huge fist against
his own chest and bending his
body in awkward imitation of the
lad's courtly gesture.</p>

<p>They made no attempt to converse
in tongues that would convey
no meaning, but there was no mistaking
the quick friendship that
sprang up between the incongruous
pair. Mado was the boy's slave from
that moment, and Nazu looked up to
the Martian with all of youth's
admiration for his vast bulk and
rippling muscles.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were without light
and Carr saw that a curtain of
woven rushes had been dropped
over the mouth of the cave. There
were soft padding footsteps on
every side and he drew back against
the rock wall with Ora clasped in
his arms. A sinewy hand grasped
his wrist and twisted his right arm
free. He lashed out in the darkness
and was rewarded by a grunt of
pain as his fist contacted with an
unseen face. Nazu's voice rose in
anguish, and Mado's wrathful bellow
was followed by a frightful
commotion as he tore into his assailants.</p>

<p>They were everywhere in the
blackness, these slippery little savages
of Titan, their half naked
bodies crowding him and stifling
him with their sweaty nearness.
Again and again Carr struck out,
but it was like fighting a horde of
squirming and clawing feline creatures
that swarmed over him and
bore him down by sheer weight of
numbers. They dragged Ora from
his arms and quickly overpowered
him. Thongs of rawhide twisted
deeply into the flesh of his wrists
and he was hauled forth into the
daylight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Securely tied, hand and foot,
Carr was propped sitting with
his back to a huge boulder. He
saw they had been carried to the
place they had viewed in the disk
of the rulden. A dozen paces away,
Ora and Mado sat similarly bound.
The Martian had been gagged as
well and Carr was forced to smile
despite the seriousness of the situation.
His mad bellowings must
have proved as painful to the
ears of the red dwarfs as had his
fists to their bodies.</p>

<p>Nazu, unbound and walking
proudly erect, was being marched
to the edge of a smoking fissure
by two of the savages. No others
of the red men were in sight.</p>

<p>Carr shuddered. It was the place
of sacrifice they had seen in the
rulden, and the natives were in
hiding as before. Nazu would be
first to go; then Ora, most likely.
He strained desperately at his bonds
when he realized the awful significance
of their position. It was
incredible that Ora was here and
in the hands of these unspeakable
monsters. Why, she'd be thrown
into the incandescent folds of the
flapping fire-god, along with the
rest of them! He groaned in an
agony of self-recrimination; he
should not have allowed her to
come on this mad voyage.</p>

<p>Then came that roaring column
of flame from out the crater, and
the weird fluttering thing whose intense
heat radiated across the intervening
space like the breath of a
blast furnace. The rumble of drums
commenced, and thousands of the
red men dashed over the rocky
area to worship at the shrine of
their pitiless god.</p>

<p>As their monotonous chant rose
high, Nazu was rushed to the edge
of the pit. The ghastly, shimmering
heat-ghost drifted hungrily to
await the flinging of the slight
form into its consuming embrace.
Carr was glad to see that Ora had
turned her head.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And then there came a sucking
noise from the depths of
the crater, and the pillar of blue
flame vanished abruptly, the incandescent
ghost-shape flapping disconsolately
in its wake. The chant
of the savages trailed off into a
chorus of disgruntled murmurings
and the booming of the drums died
down in disappointment. The worshippers
had been cheated of their
sadistic pleasure. There was something
wrong with the timing of
the rite; their mysterious fire-god
had granted the captives a reprieve.</p>

<p>But the prisoners were not deceived
by the solicitous treatment
accorded them by their captors
when they were returned to the
cave and their bonds were severed.
For well they knew that at the
next appearance of the phenomenon
of the pit they would be dragged
off to the sacrifice. Sooner or later
all of them were to meet the fate
of those given into the embrace
of the heat-demon.</p>

<p>A guard of fifty or more of the
savages, armed with blow-guns and
stone hatchets, paraded continuously
before the mouth of the
cave as one of their number returned
with a huge woven container
of fruits and nuts of strange form
and color. This was set before them
and the bearer withdrew.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Mado grunted. "Seems
like they want to fatten us up for
this heated sheet of theirs. Like
hogs fattened for the market."</p>

<p>But he reached for the striped
yellow melon atop the heap, and,
at a bright nod of approval from
Nazu, bit into its smooth skin.</p>

<p>Carr's stomach rebelled when he
looked at the food. He could not
bear the sight of the stuff, sitting
there in the damp cavern with Ora's
blue eyes regarding him in the dim
light. Those wide eyes held a gleam
of hope and trust that would not
be discouraged.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He gazed out through the cave
mouth and calculated their
chances. There were none. Not
against that horde of barbarians;
there were too many of the devils
to fight with their bare hands. If
only they had their ray pistols, or
a torpedo projector. At least they
could sell their lives dearly. His
eyes narrowed speculatively when
they came to rest on a peculiar egg-shaped
object that stood out there
in the open. It was Nazu's ovoid.
Here was an idea!</p>

<p>But he saw that its entrance door
was open and that the space inside
was too small for any of them excepting
one of the small stature of
the Titanese. It was crammed with
machinery. Nazu was the only one
of their number who could squeeze
into the thing; in fact he alone
knew how to operate the queer
flying machine. There must be
others of his kind, plenty of them;
another country, or a city full of
them at least. Perhaps he might obtain
aid if only he could be made to
understand, and if they could get
him out there safely somehow.</p>

<p>"Mado," he called, pointing, "do
you suppose we could dope out a
way of getting Nazu aboard his sky
vehicle to go for help?"</p>

<p>The Martian stared, his mouth
stuffed with food and his jaws in
full action. He strained suddenly
to swallow the huge mouthful so
he could make reply.</p>

<p>"Not a chance," he grunted. "Why,
there's a million of them out there.
You won't catch them napping."</p>

<p>But he turned his attention from
the basket of fruit and made a desperate
effort to convey the idea to
Nazu, whose bright eyes took in his
every significant motion and whose
sensitive fingers traced images in the
sand that conveyed his own thoughts
to the mind of the Martian in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>"He's got it!" Mado gloated. "The
game little cuss would go in a minute
if we could get him to the
ovoid. He's got a picture of a big
island here, so help me! An island
covered with circular dwellings,
made of metal like the ovoids, he
indicates. Look here."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carr and Ora moved over to
watch the swift sketching of
the Titanese lad. By means of pantomime
and his carefully drawn pictures,
he told them of his people,
making it clear that they were forced
to live in insulated dwellings and
travel only in the ovoids, which likewise
were insulated against the devastating
vibrations that emanated
from Saturn's rings. He sketched
those rings, illustrating the vibrations
and tapping his own forehead
in explanation of the effect on the
brain; pointing to the savages to
indicate the ultimate fate of his
kind. The protective insulation, it
appeared, was not permanent;
sooner or later, all of them would
become barbarians like the others.</p>

<p>The savages out there were their
fathers, mothers, sisters and
brothers, gone mad; their skins
darkened by continued action of
the vibrations after they fled their
insulated homes. His pictures of
the family life were meticulously
drawn. His people never warred
upon these savage kin of theirs&mdash;naturally&mdash;though
the reverse was
not always true. However, Nazu
pointed to the ovoid and showed
his willingness to help the
strangers. But he shook his head
sadly as he counted the barbarians
on his fingers, multiplying the number
endlessly by clapping his hands.
There were too many of them; the
thing was impossible.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Carr exclaimed.
"He's a marvel at communicating
his thoughts without words. But
I'd think his people would beat
it for the hills without waiting.
Might as well have it over with."</p>

<p>"But, they're still working on
the problem," Ora objected. "With
their wisdom, they'll finally get
the thing under control. And they
probably hope to discover a way of
restoring their maddened relatives."</p>

<p>She was doing something with the
red sand; wetting her fingers in a
trickle of water that oozed from
the wall and making a red paste
which she smeared on her white
forearm and then rubbed off.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," Carr admitted.
Then, watching her strange
performance, he asked, "What are
you doing?"</p>

<p>She looked up with sparkling
eyes and stretched forth her arm.
"It stains, Carr, see!" she exclaimed
excitedly. "We can fix up Nazu to
resemble one of the savages. It is
the exact color of their skin."</p>

<p>"Mado!" he called, sensing at
once the possibilities of her discovery.
They could make up Nazu
to perfection. Mingling with the
barbarians unsuspected, he might
get possession of the ovoid.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Titanese lad fell in with
the idea at once and the two
men started work on him with
water and the powdery stuff they
had taken for red sand. They
stripped him of his silken garment
and smeared him from head
to foot, Carr taking especial care
to see that his upper body and
face were thoroughly covered.
Then, after using his own clothing
to swab off the coating, they
stepped back to view the result. He
was exactly like one of the red
men in color now, and he stood
there twisting his face in a wicked
grin to heighten the similarity.</p>

<p>"The little devil!" Mado
chuckled. "He gets the idea perfectly.
We'll have to muss his hair
now and fix him up with a kirtle
like theirs."</p>

<p>Removing his suede jacket and
turning it inside out, he draped it
about the slim hips of Nazu, then
slapped his chest approvingly.
"There you are, lad," he told the
grinning youngster. "A tough-looking
kid we've made of you, too."</p>

<p>The words were lost on the young
Titanese, but his bright eyes showed
that he fully comprehended the
humor as well as the gravity of the
situation. The improvised covering
would pass without question as one
of the untanned hides the barbarians
wore dangling from their
waists. The disguise was faultless.</p>

<p>Ora had been watching at the
mouth of the cave. Now she called
out in low-voiced warning, "Hurry!
One of them is coming."</p>

<p>Carr moved forward swiftly to
face the opening, while Mado stood
with his great bulk hiding the now
unrecognizable Nazu. The savage
entered, proceeding directly to
where Carr was standing. He bent
over the fruit basket and then the
Earth-man was upon him.</p>

<p>The wiry red man struggled
furiously, but Carr had a grip on
his windpipe that stopped his attempts
to cry out and quickly reduced
him to a state of flabby subjection.
Then he bound and gagged
his captive, tearing strips of linen
from his own shirt to provide the
necessary material. In a moment
they had bundled the trussed-up
dwarf into a dark corner of the
cavern, and Nazu stepped forth
blithely to lift the basket to his
shoulder.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Everything seemed to happen
at once after that. Nazu
stalked boldly out among the savages,
who paid him no attention
whatsoever. He passed out of their
field of vision for a moment, and
then they saw him at the circular
door of the ovoid. In a flash he was
inside and the thing soared speedily
into the air and out of sight. The
red men broke forth in a babel
of excited jabbering and then they
were crowding into the cave, hundreds
of them it seemed, shrieking
their rage as they attacked the hapless
prisoners.</p>

<p>Carr went down fighting madly
but to no avail. He hadn't counted
on this; he should have known
better. A crushing weight of them
was upon him, clawing and beating
at him as he struggled to rise. They
were suffocating him with their
rank animal odors.</p>

<p>And then he was dragged into the
open air. Battered and dazed, he saw
they had found their fellow, the
one he had bound and gagged. Ora
was considerably mussed up, but
unharmed, he observed with relief;
but Mado lay there inert. This was
the first time Carr had ever seen
him take the count at the hands of
man.</p>

<p>When they had untied the one
whose place had been taken by
Nazu, he came straight for the
Earth-man and would have brained
him with a huge stone had not his
fellows interfered. He objected
strenuously, his eyes red with hate
and a torrent of harsh gutturals
pouring from his lips. But the
others held him off; this strange
white giant from the machine of
the skies was to be saved for the
embrace of the fire-god.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With the entire blame for
Nazu's escape thus placed
upon the Terrestrial, Ora and Mado
were returned to the cavern and
left unmolested. But Carr was
prodded into moving over against
a boulder and was surrounded by
a semi-circle of the dwarfs who
squatted calmly to watch him, blow-guns
in their hands and stone
hatchets on the ground within easy
reach. They were taking no more
chances with this one.</p>

<p>The long day of Titan dragged
interminably but the watchful eyes
of his guards never strayed from
their prisoner. At any moment the
fire-god might make an appearance
and the rite of sacrifice take place.
Carr supposed that the thing made
more or less regular appearances,
like a geyser of Earth. And, next
time, there would be no escape.</p>

<p>Night fell, and still those eyes
watched intently in the light reflected
against the low-flung clouds
from the seething crater nearby.
Nothing had been seen of Nazu
or any of the ovoids. Probably it
was useless to expect them; they
could not bring themselves to do
battle against these savage kin of
theirs. Anyway, he was glad the
little fellow had gotten away; he
hoped he was safely in bed&mdash;if they
had beds in those insulated dwellings.</p>

<p>He could not sleep. All through
the night he sat with bowed head,
alternately planning rescue attempts
and cursing himself for bringing
Ora to this horrible end. Detis was
dead; the <i>Nomad</i> was hopelessly
beyond repair for many days, even
if they could make their escape
and locate it; Nazu had saved his
own skin, and they were left to the
mercy of these vibration-crazed
brutes who waited there in the
flickering red twilight all around
him. It was a revolting ending for
an adventure that had started so
auspiciously.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With the first faint light of
dawn came the roaring of
the pillar of flame from out the
crater. Instantly there rose the
hollow booming of the drums and
the chanting of thousands of the
barbarous worshippers. The place
was swarming with them almost instantly,
and Carr's guards closed in
on him with evil glee.</p>

<p>Ora was brought out into the
open, her arms held fast by two of
the red devils who yanked her
roughly along between them. Carr
roared out in blind rage and in
awful fear for the girl. He struck
out viciously into the first grinning
face that pressed near. Something
in his brain seemed to snap then,
and he became a snarling, fighting
animal, battling against overwhelming
odds in defence of his mate.
A dart buried itself in his arm
and a stone hatchet bit into his
shoulder, but he scarcely felt the
hurts. All that mattered now was
Ora; they were taking her away&mdash;taking
her to the folds of that incredible
hot thing that flapped there
at the crater's rim. An arm snapped
like a pipestem in his fingers and
he heard the squeal of pain from
somewhere in the tangled mass of
savages around him.</p>

<p>And then they were falling back;
easing up on him. The din was increasing,
but it seemed that a note
of fear had crept in to replace the
exultant frenzy of those chanting
voices. The drums were stilled.</p>

<p>Wiping the blood from his eyes
with the back of his hand, he saw
the barbarians running everywhere;
they were screaming in superstitious
terror and fighting one another
in their desperate anxiety to
escape the vicinity of their precious
fire-god. A tremendous voice
boomed out over the hubbub, a
voice that came from the crater in
vast commanding gutturals that
struck terror into the souls of the
panicky barbarians. Yet somehow
that mightily sonorous voice carried
a familiar ring.</p>

<p>Carr raised astonished eyes to the
pillar of blue flame and was seized
with a well-nigh uncontrollable impulse
to flee with the red men. For
a monstrous image of Detis swayed
there in the hot vapors, a massive
arm raised menacingly and an
equally Brobdingnagian voice issuing
from his lips in fierce syllables
of the red man's tongue!</p>

<p>"Detis!" Carr shouted. "Detis!
Ora&mdash;Mado!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And then he was running toward
the crater's edge in
bounding strides that carried him
twenty feet at a leap. He understood
now. Detis had recovered
from his wound and was reversing
the rulden's energy. He was projecting
his own image and voice,
many times amplified, into the column
of fire to terrify the savages!</p>

<p>Ora was lying there, on the rim
of the pit. She had fainted at sight
of the ghost-shape, whose white-hot
folds flapped there, reaching to
engulf her in their all-consuming
embrace. Carr babbled like a madman
as he pulled her away from the
horrible thing that pulsated with
eager flutterings not three feet
away, its hot breath singeing her
silken lashes and brows.</p>

<p>Mado was there, encouraging him
and yelling something else he
couldn't understand; pointing skyward.
And then he saw it; the
<i>Nomad</i>, with its sleek, tapered cylinder
of a body nosing down toward
them with the silvery aura of
its propulsive energy gleaming like
a beacon of hope against the dull
clouds of the satellite of terror.
And there was something else: one
of the ovoids of Titan, clinging
there to the vessel's hull plates,
alongside the open manhole. Nazu
had not failed them after all. His
mind refused to question the miracle
further.</p>

<p>Somehow, when the vessel landed,
he managed to reach the manhole
with his precious burden. He staggered
through the passageway and
into their stateroom, tenderly
stretching Ora on her own bed. In
the next instant he was rummaging
in the medicine closet. He found
ointment for her burns; smelling
salts; damp cloths. With trembling
fingers he ministered to her, a great
joy welling up within him as he
saw she was recovering. Another
minute, back there at the crater, and
he'd have lost her forever. He
swallowed hard at the thought, his
eyes misty as he looked down at
her and remembered.</p>

<p>Impatiently he jerked the barbed
dart from his arm and poured a
powerful antiseptic into the open
wound, unmindful of the pain. As
best he could, he disinfected his
other cuts and bandaged them. Ora
had raised herself and now sat
there, swaying weakly and regarding
him with anxious gaze.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A little later they made
their way forward to the control
room. The <i>Nomad</i> had taken
off and was drifting slowly higher.
At the controls sat a strange, bedaubed
figure. Nazu!</p>

<p>Mado was peering through the
coils of a helix of silver ribbon
that had been erected beside the
rulden.</p>

<p>"Father!" Ora darted past him
and dropped to her knees on the
floor-plates at the Martian's side.
The body of Detis was slumped
there a ghastly corpse within those
gleaming coils. But his kind features
were fixed in a serene smile.
He had gone to his reward with
content in his heart.</p>

<p>Only then did Carr remember.
One could not subject his body to
the reversed energies of the rulden
without certain expectation of death.
A few short seconds with those terrible
oscillations surging through
his being, carrying the amplified
visual and oral reproduction
through the ether, and the Europan
scientist had perished. Knowingly,
willingly, Detis had given
his life that the rest of them might
live! Recovered miraculously from
his first serious injury, he had done
this magnificent thing deliberately
and gladly....</p>

<p>A great lump rose in Carr's
throat as Ora's sobbing came to
his ears. With his vision blurred
by tears, he turned to the pilot's
seat, where Nazu faced him with
solemn eyes.</p>

<p>"Nazu go now," the amazing
young Titanese stated. He spoke in
halting syllables of Cos, the language
of the inner planets!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carr stared agape, scarcely believing
his ears.</p>

<p>"Detis great man," Nazu continued,
relinquishing his seat to the
dazed Earthman. "Nazu find him in
ship. My people already there with
him. They want to help when you
come. Return after capture and heal
dart wound of Detis. Bring wire
and help him fix motors. Work
very quick, my people. Detis have
brain machine. Talk with Nazu;
teach him words, also very quick.
Nazu tell where you are and we
come to help. Then he scare away
red men&mdash;and die. That is all. Now
I go&mdash;and you go also. Quickly."</p>

<p>"So that's how it happened," Carr
muttered, slowly mulling over the
amazing things he had heard. He
watched the Titanese lad keenly as
his eyes wandered in Mado's direction.
He saw the admiring light
that came into them as the big
Martian removed the body of Detis
from the helix and carried it gently
away.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he interposed,
as Nazu made as if to leave. "Mado
would like to talk to you."</p>

<p>"Must go soon." The youngster
drew himself up proudly. "Nazu is
prince of his people. They need
him. And you&mdash;you must go at
once. Vibrations of mother planet's
rings work on you too long already.
Must be quick. Else you be wild
men&mdash;like those down there."</p>

<p>He waved his arm in a gesture
that embraced all Titan. Anxiety
was written large on his countenance
and his gaze traveled nervously
to the door through which
Mado must return.</p>

<p>The big Martian was not long in
coming. He had carried the body
of Detis aft, leaving Ora there with
her dead. Carr's heart ached for
her; he knew how silently and
terribly she suffered. Knowing that
her father had been healed of his
deadly wound by the friendly
Titanese, only to be taken from
her afterwards by his own heroic
act, made the blow doubly hard.</p>

<p>Later they would give Detis a
decent burial, sending him through
the airlock to drift aimlessly in
space, preserved through the ages
by the intense cold and the absence
of air. A fitting tomb for the
noblest of the vagabonds!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mado chattered endlessly with
Nazu, who was impatient to
be off. Seeing that it was impossible
to detain him, and realizing
at last the stern necessity of hastening
their own departure, he finally
let him go. The youngster bid Carr
a sober, friendly farewell and followed
Mado to the airlock.</p>

<p>Carr heard the clang of the manhole
cover as it swung home, and
was bolted to its seat. The ovoid
drifted away from the vessel and
dropped toward the forest beneath
them. Nazu had gone to rejoin his
people.</p>

<p>His fingers strayed to the controls.
They must get away from the
evil influence of those vibrations;
he had felt something of their degrading
power in the fighting down
there. He had almost become a savage
himself, he remembered with a
revulsion of feeling.</p>

<p>The feel of the levers brought
to him a renewed sense of confidence
and responsibility. A while
back he thought he'd never perform
such simple duties again. The
<i>Nomad</i> responded instantly and
rose swiftly to hover over the pit
of the fire-god. The flame had
partly subsided and the ghost-shape
wabbled there, changing form rapidly
with darkening colors. Some
weird phenomenon of nature that
those brutes had set up as a deity.</p>

<p>Carr increased the repulsion
energy once more and the <i>Nomad</i>
shot skyward like a rocket. Through
the floor port he saw Nazu's tiny
ovoid scudding over the treetops.
Then it had vanished.</p>

<p>"We're getting away none too
soon," said Mado, rejoining him.</p>

<p>"Right." Carr watched the temperature
indicator as he increased
speed to the maximum they could
withstand in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>They were out above the cloud
layer then and he cast apprehensive
eyes on the enormous flat disks
encircling the great globe that was
Saturn. Something like a hundred
and seventy thousand miles across
them, he remembered. But the
astronomers of the inner planets
had little actual knowledge of their
composition; they knew nothing at
all of their terrible power or their
strange inhabitants.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <i>Nomad</i> left Titan with tremendous
acceleration now, as
he increased the speed of the rejuvenated
generators. They'd go
on, on toward Uranus, Neptune&mdash;anywhere,
away from this ringed
planet that was responsible for the
death of one of their number; away
from the region that was soon to
become the tomb of Detis.</p>

<p>There was silence then as the
<i>Nomad</i> raced on through the blackness.
Mado gripped the rail of the
port and peered long and earnestly
at the tiny pinpoint of light that
now was Titan.</p>

<p>"Great kid, that Nazu," the Martian
said, after a while. "Too bad
he couldn't come along with us."</p>

<p>"Yes." Carr was thinking of the
different life there would be on
board the <i>Nomad</i>; and well he
knew that Mado was thinking of
the same thing. The Martian had
missed the close companionship of
his Terrestrial friend since his marriage
to Ora; missed it more than
he would admit, even to himself.
And the lad, Nazu, had appealed
to him; he would have fathered
him as only a lonely bachelor can.
Suddenly Carr's own friendship for
the big fellow seemed a wonderful
thing.</p>

<p>"Never mind, old man," he whispered,
reaching over and gripping
Mado's hand mightily, "We'll be
a three-cornered family, Ora and
you and I. And, who knows but
that you'll find the one and only
girl yourself, some fine day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" Mado grunted.</p>

<p>But a big hand closed down hard
on Carr's fingers, and the Earthman
knew that their friendship was
more firmly cemented than ever before.</p>
